## Documentation Structure

Our project follows a hub-and-spoke documentation model:

- **[Project Status](../STATUS.md)** - Current status and progress tracking
- **[Operations Hub](../admin/operations/README.md)** - Server administration and troubleshooting
- **[Research Hub](../admin/planning/research/README.md)** - Technology research and comparisons

### Documentation Categories

#### Planning & Research
- `admin/planning/research/` - Technology research and comparisons
- `admin/planning/decisions/` - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- `admin/planning/notes/` - Planning insights and project notes

#### Operations
- `admin/operations/` - Server administration, troubleshooting, and maintenance guides

#### General Documentation
- `docs/` - Project-wide documentation standards and guidelines

## Contributing to Documentation

### Guidelines

1. **Follow Hub-and-Spoke Model** - Create focused documents with clear purposes
2. **Keep Documents Focused** - Each document should have a single, clear purpose
3. **Link Between Documents** - Use cross-references to connect related information
4. **Update Status** - Keep checkboxes and status indicators current
5. **Archive, Don't Delete** - Move outdated documents to archive folders

### Document Types

- **README.md** - Hub documents that provide overviews and quick links
- **Technical Guides** - Step-by-step procedures and troubleshooting
- **Research Documents** - Technology comparisons and decision records
- **Planning Documents** - Project notes and feature planning

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens
- Include document type in filename when helpful (e.g., `-guide.md`, `-research.md`)
- Use consistent naming patterns within directories
