# OurFileServer - Initial Setup and Research Plan

## Overview

Set up minimal project structure following hub-and-spoke best practices and begin researching file server technologies that can scale from home use to internet-accessible solutions.

## Structure Setup

### 1. Directory Structure

Create the following minimal structure (incorporating suggested improvements):

```
OurFileServer/
├── .cursor/rules/
│   └── main.mdc                    # Project-specific AI rules
├── admin/
│   ├── planning/
│   │   ├── research/               # Technology research
│   │   ├── features/               # Future feature planning
│   │   ├── decisions/              # Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
│   │   └── notes/                  # Planning notes
│   └── chat-logs/                  # Conversation history
├── docs/                           # User documentation (future)
├── README.md                       # Project hub
└── STATUS.md                       # Quick status overview
```

### 2. Update Cursor Rules (`main.mdc`)

Add project-specific rules including:

- Hub-and-spoke documentation principles
- Project context (home file server, networking learning, partner collaboration)
- Scalability focus (home → internet-accessible)
- Reference to hub-and-spoke best practices document

### 3. Create Project README

Minimal hub document with:

- Project purpose and goals
- Quick links to research and planning docs
- Current status (research phase)
- Next steps

## Research Documentation

### 4. Create Research Document (`admin/planning/research/file-server-technologies.md`)

Comprehensive comparison covering:

**Technology Categories:**

- NAS Solutions (Synology, QNAP, TrueNAS)
- Cloud-like Platforms (Nextcloud, ownCloud, Seafile)
- Traditional File Servers (Samba/SMB, NFS)
- Sync Solutions (Syncthing, Resilio Sync)
- Custom/DIY Solutions (Python/Node.js servers)

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Ease of setup for beginners
- Home network functionality
- Internet accessibility/remote access
- Security features
- Scalability potential
- Hardware requirements
- Cost (free vs. paid)
- Learning opportunity for networking concepts
- Partner-friendly UI/UX

**Structure:**

- Overview of each technology
- Pros/cons
- Home use case fit
- Scalability to internet access
- Recommended hardware/software stack
- Learning curve assessment

### 5. Create Research README (`admin/planning/research/README.md`)

Hub for research documents with:

- Links to technology comparisons
- Decision criteria
- Next research topics (security, networking basics, etc.)

## Files to Create/Modify

1. `.cursor/rules/main.mdc` - Add comprehensive project rules
2. `README.md` - Project hub (minimal, following template)
3. `admin/planning/research/README.md` - Research hub
4. `admin/planning/research/file-server-technologies.md` - Technology comparison

## Suggested Improvements to Hub-and-Spoke Model

Based on your evolving pattern, consider:

- Add a `STATUS.md` at project root for quick status overview (vs. embedding in README)
- Consider `admin/planning/decisions/` folder for architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Add `admin/planning/research/README.md` as a hub for all research docs (not just one big file)

## Out of Scope (This Phase)

- Actual implementation/coding
- Detailed network diagrams
- Hardware purchasing decisions
- Security hardening guides
- Docker/containerization setup

### To-dos

- [ ] Update .cursor/rules/main.mdc with project-specific rules and context
- [ ] Create minimal README.md as project hub following hub-and-spoke pattern
- [ ] Create admin/planning/research/README.md as research documentation hub
- [ ] Create comprehensive file-server-technologies.md research document
