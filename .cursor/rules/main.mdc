# OurFileServer Project Rules

## Project Context
- **Purpose**: Home file server for sharing files and information between partners
- **Learning Goal**: Understanding networking concepts and file server technologies
- **Scalability**: Design for home use with potential to scale to internet-accessible solution
- **Collaboration**: Partner-friendly interface and setup

## Documentation Standards
- Follow hub-and-spoke documentation model (see `hub-and-spoke-documentation-best-practices.md`)
- Use focused documents with single clear purpose
- Keep documents under 400 lines when possible
- Update checkboxes and status as work progresses
- Link between related documents for easy navigation

## Development Approach
- Research-first approach for technology decisions
- Document all findings and decisions in `admin/planning/`
- Prioritize solutions that are beginner-friendly but scalable
- Consider both technical learning and practical usability
- Archive old documents rather than deleting them

## File Organization
- `admin/planning/research/` - Technology research and comparisons
- `admin/planning/decisions/` - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- `admin/planning/features/` - Feature planning and implementation
- `admin/planning/notes/` - General planning notes and insights
- `STATUS.md` - Quick project status overview
- `README.md` - Project hub with quick links

## Quality Standards
- Research should be comprehensive but accessible
- Document pros/cons for each technology option
- Include learning curve assessments
- Consider partner usability in all recommendations
- Focus on practical implementation over theoretical perfection
