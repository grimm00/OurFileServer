Looking to make a file server for my home.

I'm looking to see what's the best way to have a central hub for sharing files and
even information between just me and my partner across the home. This would double
as an exercise for me to understand how networking works, but we would really
like to be able to make this work. 

If you look at our ~/projects/pokedex, this is my pokehub project. It is currently on the 
development branch so you should be able to see the most current project state.
There is a ProjectStructre.md in the admin folder, but it has expanded since then. That said, 
of course this may be a simpler project but you can kind of see what kind
of structure I'm looking for.

As far as workflow, There is a hub-and-spoke file I added to kind of
show the best practices that we want in a while. Please fill out main.mdc
to bind these rules to this project's ongoing devlopment.

Also, there should be a "research" folder in admin. In this folder, we 
should look into the best options for this project, and ideally, this
will have the potential to be scaled up from a home solution to one
that can be accessed from anywhere.
