## üîë Shared Credentials

**Everyone uses the same login:**
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `cEGiUWGN48mC3jGO`

**Who uses these credentials:**
- You (the administrator)

## üîß API Access for Automation

### What is API Access?

API access lets external applications (scripts, apps, tools) access your files programmatically.

### When to Use API Access

- **Automated backups** - scripts that backup files
- **File synchronization** - sync files between devices
- **Mobile apps** - custom apps for file access
- **Integration tools** - connect with other services

### How to Get API Access

1. **Login to web interface**
2. **Go to Settings** (gear icon)
3. **Find "API" section**
4. **Generate new token**
5. **Copy the token**
6. **Use token in your applications**

### Example API Usage

**List files:**
```bash
curl -H "X-Auth: YOUR_TOKEN" http://[your-ip]:8080/api/resources
```

**Upload file:**
```bash
curl -H "X-Auth: YOUR_TOKEN" -F "file=@myfile.txt" http://[your-ip]:8080/api/resources
```

## üîí Security for Home Use

### Is This Secure?

**For home network use:** Yes, this is secure and appropriate.

**Why it's secure:**
- **Home network only** - not accessible from internet
- **Trusted users** - you and your partner
- **Can revoke access** - if device is lost
- **Audit trail** - can see who accessed what

### What Changed Security-Wise

**Before:** Anyone on your network could access files
**After:** Only people with the shared password can access files

**Benefits:**
- **Protection** if someone else connects to your network
- **Control** over who can access your files
- **API access** for automation while maintaining security

## üÜò Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to login every time?
**A:** No! Login once per device, stay logged in for 1 year.

### Q: What if I forget the password?
**A:** The password is `cEGiUWGN48mC3jGO`. You can change it if you want.

### Q: Can I change the password?
**A:** Yes, but everyone will need the new password. See the operations guide.

### Q: What if I get logged out?
**A:** Just login again with the same credentials. Sessions last 1 year, so this should be rare.

### Q: Can I have separate accounts for different people?
**A:** Not in the current setup. Everyone shares the same admin account for simplicity.

### Q: What if I want separate accounts later?
**A:** That's possible but more complex. The current setup is designed for simplicity.

### Q: Do my files change?
**A:** No! All your files are exactly the same. Only the access method changed.

### Q: Is this slower than before?
**A:** No, same performance. The authentication adds minimal overhead.

## üîÑ What to Do If Something Goes Wrong

### Can't Login

1. **Check password:** Make sure it's exactly `cEGiUWGN48mC3jGO`
2. **Check username:** Make sure it's exactly `admin`
3. **Try different browser:** Sometimes browser cache causes issues
4. **Clear browser data:** Clear cookies and localStorage

### Lost Access

1. **Check if container is running:** `docker compose ps`
2. **Restart container:** `docker compose restart`
3. **Check logs:** `docker compose logs filebrowser`

### Want to Go Back to No-Auth

1. **Follow rollback guide** in migration documentation
2. **This will remove authentication** and return to direct access
3. **All files remain the same**
